On this slide, we’ve isolated only the training RMSE to allow for a clearer comparison between the AI Profile (left) and the Model CD Profile (right), across all groups and slits.

The AI Profile consistently shows a downward trend in RMSE, which is characteristic of effective training—this behavior is similar to how a typical loss function decreases as the model learns. On the other hand, the Model CD Profile often displays flat or increasing RMSE, indicating a weak alignment with the training process.

In the next slide, we will look at the validation RMSE only, to investigate generalization performance and to assess signs of overfitting or underfitting across the two profiles.
