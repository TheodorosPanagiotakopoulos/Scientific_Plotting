# Neuron Flow Loss Calculator

This repository calculates `loss0`, `loss1`, `loss2`, and `lossAll` for Neuron Flow jobs.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites

- Python environment with access to `tachyon_python`.

---

## ⚙️ Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. In `collect_loss.py`, update the `path` variable to point to your Neuron job.
3. Ensure `get_loss.py` is placed in the same folder as `collect_loss.py`, since it is called internally.
4. Set the `verbose` flag in `collect_loss.py` to `True` or `False` depending on whether you want to view detailed loss output.

```python
verbose = True  # or False
```

---

## ▶️ How to Run

Make sure both `collect_loss.py` and `get_loss.py` are in the same directory. Then execute:

```bash
/nfs/software/ME/tachyon_flux_225.08.c/releases/LSF/bin/tachyon_python collect_loss.py
```

The script will output the losses as Python lists:

```
Loss0: [...]
Loss1: [...]
Loss2: [...]
LossAll: [...]
```

These lists can be used for further analysis, visualization, or diagnostics.
