# AI Error Data Collection Pipeline

This repository contains scripts used to collect and process AI error data from one or two process paths. The pipeline is currently under development and aims to automate the analysis and plotting of AI error metrics.

## Project Structure

There are **two modes of operation**, depending on whether your job has one or two paths.

---

### üìÅ Single Path Mode

If your job is completed **in one path**, use the following scripts:

- `get_data_ai_profile_one_path.py`
- `collect_AIerror_one_path.py`

**Instructions:**

1. Place both scripts in the same folder.
2. Run `collect_AIerror_one_path.py`. It will call `get_data_ai_profile_one_path.py` internally.

---

### üìÅ Dual Path Mode

If your job is completed **in two paths**, use the following scripts:

- `get_data_ai_profile_two_paths.py`
- `collect_AIerror_two_paths.py`

**Instructions:**

1. Place both scripts in the same folder.
2. Run `collect_AIerror_two_paths.py`. It will call `get_data_ai_profile_two_paths.py` internally.

### üîß EUV or DUV Configuration

Depending on whether your data is from **EUV** or **DUV** tools, you must **modify the `apply_filters` function** in the main script accordingly. Make sure the filtering logic reflects your specific use case.

---

### üöß Development Status

The pipeline is **under active development**, especially the automation of AI error plotting. Fixes and enhancements are being made continuously.
