📉 Why Are RMSE Values Increasing? (And Why is Validation < Training?)

🚨 Unexpected Trend Observed:

Both Training and Validation RMSE increase over epochs.

Validation RMSE is lower than Training RMSE – counterintuitive!



---

🔍 What This Might Mean

Possible Cause	Description	Impact

Data Leakage	Validation set may contain seen data	Validation error appears deceptively low
Incorrect RMSE Calculation	Training/validation metrics not computed equally	Misleading performance metrics
Too-High Learning Rate	Model overshoots optimal weights	Training becomes unstable
Model Misconfiguration	Wrong .train() or .eval() mode (e.g., BatchNorm, Dropout)	Evaluation mismatch



---

✅ Recommended Actions

1. Check data splits for overlap or leakage.


2. Verify RMSE computation on both datasets.


3. Reduce learning rate (e.g., divide by 10).


4. Ensure proper mode switching between training and evaluation.
