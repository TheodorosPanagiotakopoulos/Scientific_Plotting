1. Proving that embeddings capture true “semantics”

To show that a 2 048-dimensional feature vector isn’t just noise, I’d recommend:

1. Retrieval benchmarks

Assemble a small ground-truth library of rigorous simulated images grouped by known defect types or layout families.

For each query image, retrieve the top-k nearest neighbours in embedding space and compute precision@k. Achieving ≥ 90 % precision@5 is a clear quantitative signal that your embeddings respect human-defined semantics.



2. Clustering & visualization

Run UMAP or t-SNE on your embeddings and color-code by defect class or mask family. When semantically similar patterns form tight clusters (and dissimilar ones remain separate), it’s a powerful visual validation.



3. Transfer on a downstream task

Freeze the fine-tuned backbone and train a lightweight classifier (or regressor) on a related labeling task—say, predicting defect severity from the embeddings alone. If you outperform pixel-based baselines, that proves the vectors encode meaningful, generalizable structure.

2. Choosing a “best known” threshold

Rather than quoting 0.99 or 0.95 out of thin air, I’d give customers a reproducible calibration recipe:

1. Label a small set of pairs as “same pattern” vs. “different.”


2. Plot an ROC curve for cosine similarity as a binary classifier, and pick the threshold that maximizes your desired F₁ or precision/recall trade-off.


3. Inspect similarity histograms—often there’s a dip between in-set and out-of-set peaks. The midpoint is an intuitive cutoff.


4. For heterogeneous data, you can even derive per-cluster thresholds using local density estimates.



This gives you a Best-Known Methodology rather than a one-size-fits-all constant.

3. Supervised vs. unsupervised in Method 1

It’s a hybrid:

Supervised fine-tuning: We use before-vs-after labels to teach the network which patterns are “rigorous simulated” vs. raw mask.

Unsupervised novelty detection: The cosine-similarity step on embeddings is entirely label-free, flagging any validation result that lies outside the learned embedding manifold.


Contrast that with an IBPS autoencoder, which is fully unsupervised. If you lack before/after labels, you could swap to a contrastive or autoencoding objective for feature learning—but fine-tuning often yields more domain-specific sensitivity.

4. Handling small shifts in perceptual hashing

Standard perceptual hashes (aHash, pHash) are brittle to translation or rotation. You can address this by:

1. Pre-alignment

Detect keypoints (ORB, SIFT), compute the homography between mask and simulated output, warp to a canonical frame, then hash.



2. Shift-invariant hashing

Use block-mean or radial-variance hashes, which average over local blocks or project into polar coordinates, making them robust to minor shifts.



3. Hybrid pipeline

First filter with the embedding similarity (robust to shifts), then confirm with a fast hash for exact duplicates.



4. Local-descriptor matching

Extract and match local ORB or AKAZE features, which inherently tolerate small translations without requiring full-image hashing.

5. Proposal refinements & IBPS alignment

Unified encoder: Rather than two separate branches (fine-tune vs. autoencoder), consider a contrastive encoder trained directly on (mask, rigorous simulated) pairs. You get embeddings optimized for your end-goal without external labels, blending IBPS’s fully-trained autoencoder approach with our semantic-similarity objective.

Calibration toolkit: Deliver a small script that (a) samples positive/negative pairs, (b) visualizes similarity distributions and ROC curves, and (c) recommends thresholds automatically.

Explainability layer: For every flagged “novel” result, present its nearest neighbor from training side-by-side. This human-in-the-loop check builds trust in your metric.



---

Bottom line:

Embeddings represent semantics when they pass retrieval, clustering, and transfer tests.

Thresholds should emerge from a calibration process, not a hardcoded value.

Method 1 is a hybrid of supervised fine-tuning and unsupervised similarity search.

Perceptual hashes alone can falter under shifts—either pre-align, choose shift-invariant variants, or layer embedding filtering first.
