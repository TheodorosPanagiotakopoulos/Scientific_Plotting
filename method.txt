My diagnosis:

Training and validation RMSE fall in the first 4 epochs, then rise for the remainder.

Explanation:
The optimiser initially finds a shallow minimum, giving a brief loss reduction.
After epoch 4, weight updates start overshooting or oscillating; both losses trend upward, a classic sign of training-time instability.


---

Validation RMSE remains higher than training RMSE at every epoch.

Explanation:
Validation patterns are far outside the training manifold:

CDx includes 40 nm and 200 nm (never in train)

CDy reaches 3Ã—WX (up to 600 nm)

PitchX/Y spike to 1400 / 1000 nm (train tops out at 96 nm)


These extrapolated regions are harder, so the model generalises poorly and val RMSE stays above train RMSE.


---

RMSE gap (val â€“ train) narrows early, then widens again.

It shrinks from 0.295 â†’ 0.247 as the model learns low-hanging training features.

It widens to 0.310 once divergence begins, because validation error grows faster than training error.

Diagnosis:

> Diverging model under severe distribution shift.
Not underfitting (model learned early); not classic overfitting (train loss rises too).
Root causes: high learning-rate or weak regularisation plus a validation set that is largely out-of-distribution (extreme pitch and CD combinations).

Of course, you make your own diagnosis.
