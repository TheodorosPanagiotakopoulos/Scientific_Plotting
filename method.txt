Response: Embedding-Based Similarity and Hashing Discussion

Thank you for the detailed questions — they raise important considerations. Below is a structured response addressing each point with clarifications and enhancements to our original proposal.

1. Demonstrating that Embeddings Represent Semantic Image Content

To validate that the high-dimensional feature vectors (embeddings) extracted from rigorous simulated images encode meaningful semantic information, we suggest a combination of the following strategies:

Retrieval Evaluation: Use a small, curated set of rigorous simulation results grouped by known pattern types. For each test image, retrieve the top k most similar training embeddings using cosine similarity. If the top results belong to the same category as the query image, it confirms the embedding space captures meaningful structure. Achieving 90% or more precision at top-5 would be a strong quantitative indicator.

Embedding Clustering and Visualization: Use dimensionality reduction (e.g., UMAP or t-SNE) to project the embeddings into 2D space and visually inspect whether images that are structurally or functionally similar form coherent clusters. This offers an intuitive, human-readable validation of semantic grouping.

Downstream Task Performance: Freeze the embedding extractor and use it to train a lightweight classifier or regressor on a related task (e.g., defect severity). If it significantly outperforms raw pixel features, this demonstrates that the embedding carries task-relevant information.

2. Choosing a Threshold – A Best-Known Methodology

We agree that providing a fixed similarity threshold (e.g., 0.99) is insufficient and highly case-dependent. However, we can propose a Best Known Methodology (BKM) to establish a data-driven threshold per use case:

Manual Pair Calibration: Label a small sample of validation-training pairs as “similar” or “unseen” based on domain knowledge. Plot the ROC curve using cosine similarity as the score. Select a threshold based on maximum F₁-score or desired recall.

Histogram-Based Gap Analysis: Analyze the cosine similarity distribution between known-similar vs. unrelated image pairs. In many cases, a valley exists between two peaks in the distribution, which can serve as a natural threshold.

Adaptive or Per-Cluster Thresholding: If your dataset has layout-based subgroups, local thresholds can be computed for each cluster, increasing robustness to data diversity.


This methodology gives us a defensible and repeatable approach, rather than relying on arbitrary values.

3. Is Method 1 Supervised Learning?

Method 1 is a hybrid approach:

The fine-tuning step is supervised: we use labels to teach the model to distinguish between before- and after-simulation images, allowing it to learn simulation-specific visual features.

The similarity search step is unsupervised: we compute distances between embeddings without using labels, to identify validation outputs that are semantically different from those seen during training.


In that sense, the framework incorporates both supervised feature learning and unsupervised novelty detection.

4. Hashing Limitations and Pattern Shifts

After our conversation, I now realize that what we are proposing with perceptual hashing is essentially the same approach that you’ve already tried — and found insufficient. Specifically, the issue where two images with the same pattern but slightly shifted spatial positions yield different hashes is exactly the problem we've also observed.

Hash-based methods (like pHash or aHash) are highly sensitive to even minimal spatial shifts or alignment differences, which are common in simulated results. While there are options like block mean or radial variance hashing that offer some shift-tolerance, they are still limited in robustness compared to embedding-based similarity.

This is why we recommend embedding-based comparison as the core detection method and, if necessary, using hash functions only as a final step for confirming exact duplicates — not for semantic comparison.

5. Proposal Alignment and Improvements

To better align with your current IBPS pipeline (which uses a fully-trained autoencoder), we suggest the following enhancements:

Unified Encoder Strategy: Instead of separating feature learning into a pretrained ResNet and a separate similarity module, consider using a single encoder trained with contrastive or autoencoding objectives on your mask–simulation pairs. This merges the interpretability benefits of embeddings with the unsupervised learning philosophy used in IBPS.

Calibration Toolkit: Deliver a simple calibration utility that:

Samples pairs for manual labeling,

Visualizes embedding similarity distributions,

Suggests thresholds via ROC/F₁-score optimization.


Explainability Integration: For every flagged "unseen" validation result, show the nearest training match alongside it. This human-in-the-loop comparison helps analysts understand and trust the system's behavior.



---

Summary

Embedding vectors can represent semantic image content — and we can prove it via retrieval, clustering, and transfer learning.

Thresholds should be calibrated empirically, not chosen arbitrarily.

Our approach is a hybrid of supervised fine-tuning and unsupervised similarity detection.

Perceptual hashing is not suitable for small-shift scenarios — a limitation you've already experienced.

With slight adjustments, our method aligns well with the IBPS autoencoder philosophy while addressing known pain points more robustly.


Let me know if you'd like us to walk through threshold calibration or embedding extraction live. We’d be happy to share test scripts or visual outputs.
