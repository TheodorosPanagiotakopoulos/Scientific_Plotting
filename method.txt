# Mask Team – PEG (Product Engineering Group)

## Overview

The **Mask Team** is part of the **Product Engineering Group (PEG)** at **ASML**.  
We operate under the broader umbrella of PEG, focusing on advancing the accuracy, performance, and integration of computational lithography solutions.

## Our Mission

Our work centers on improving the modeling and simulation capabilities that support ASML’s core products. We develop and maintain tooling and infrastructure used to enhance:

- **Newron M3D models** — improving physical accuracy and generalization
- **Tachyon** — enabling better simulation fidelity and throughput
- Supporting machine learning initiatives for next-generation model training and deployment

## Focus Areas

- Machine Learning for model prediction and optimization  
- Data pipelines and preprocessing for model training  
- Software tooling to integrate model improvements into product flows  
- Validation, benchmarking, and performance monitoring

## Tools & Technologies

- Python, C++, internal ML libraries
- GitLab (CI/CD, issue tracking, MRs)
- In-house compute infrastructure
- Data versioning and evaluation frameworks

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository is part of the Mask Team’s internal efforts to support ongoing ML and modeling projects. All contributions align with PEG engineering standards and product goals.
