You're thinking in the right direction, and you've clearly put effort into analyzing the data generation and RMSE trends. Here's a corrected and refined analysis, along with a succinct diagnosis for your slide:


---

✅ Correct Points:

Yes, both training and validation RMSE are increasing, which suggests the model isn’t learning effectively.

Validation RMSE being lower than training RMSE can happen when the validation set is easier — as you said, due to smoother distributions or better coverage within the training distribution.



---

❌ Misconceptions / Clarifications:

It's not overshooting minima due to optimizer behavior alone — overshooting usually causes instability or oscillation, not steady RMSE increase.

The issue is more likely that the model is underfitting: it hasn't captured enough complexity to reduce errors, possibly due to inadequate model capacity or poor feature representations.

✅ Correct Diagnosis for Slide (1–3 sentences):

> Diagnosis: The model is underfitting — both training and validation RMSE increase with epochs, indicating it fails to capture the data distribution effectively. Validation RMSE is consistently lower because the validation set is simpler and better aligned with the training distribution.
Fixes: Increase model capacity (e.g., deeper network), improve input features, or rebalance the training data for better CD/pitch/tone coverage.
