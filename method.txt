We have two questions to answer:

1. Is there a data category that behaves similarly to the loss function used in the Newron model schema?


2. Is there any observation of overfitting or underfitting based on these metrics?



To address these questions, we will use two different metrics. One will be based on the aerial image profile, and the other will be based on the Model CD profile.

More precisely, we will compare the RMSE of AI error from the absolute maximum attainable error—derived from the ML model minus the rigorous model—to the Model CD of our simulation. This will be compared against the corresponding RMSE of the Model CD from both the ML model and the rigorous simulations.
