My diagnosis:

Both training and validation RMSE steadily increase.

Explanation: After a couple of epochs, the optimizerâ€™s weights begin to overshoot minima in the loss landscape, leading to unstable training behavior and worsening prediction performance over time.


---

Validation RMSE remains above training RMSE at every epoch.

Explanation: The validation set includes CD/space/pitch combinations that are harder or less represented in the training data. Though the pitch values are similar (1690 train vs. 1600 val), the validation space range includes values (like 140, 180, 260) not well covered during training. This domain shift makes generalization more difficult and inflates validation RMSE.


---

Absolute train-val RMSE gap increases early, then decreases.

Explanation: The widening gap early on reflects the model beginning to fit the training set more easily than the validation distribution. The later narrowing is misleadingâ€”it occurs because both RMSEs are worsening, not because generalization improves.

Diagnosis:

The model is diverging, not underfitting. RMSE consistently increases across both training and validation, indicating training instability, possibly due to:

high learning rate

insufficient regularization

batch size issues

poor input normalization


The consistent gap where val_RMSE > train_RMSE shows generalization failure, likely caused by a mismatch between validation and training domains, or lack of capacity to learn robust spatial variation.

Of course, you make your own diagnosis.
