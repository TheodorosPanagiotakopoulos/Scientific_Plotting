This slide presents the Training and Validation RMSE across epochs for different groups and slits, comparing two profiles: the AI Profile (left) and the Model CD Profile (right).

From these plots, we see that the AI Profile shows a consistent downward trend in RMSE, similar to a typical loss function used during model training. This suggests that the AI Profile may closely align with how the model optimizes during learning. In contrast, the Model CD Profile does not exhibit a clear decreasing pattern, indicating a weaker correlation with the modelâ€™s optimization behavior.

To better visualize this behavior, in the next slide, we isolate the training RMSE only, removing the validation curves for improved clarity and comparison across configurations.
