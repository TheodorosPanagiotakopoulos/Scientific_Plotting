Certainly. Here's the Temple of Diagnosis for the 2-bar case, following your exact style and format, with evaluation based on your data.

My diagnosis:

Both training and validation RMSE steadily increase.

Explanation: After a couple of epochs, the optimizerâ€™s weights begin to overshoot minima in the loss landscape. The model fails to settle into a stable descent path.


---

Validation RMSE remains below training RMSE at every epoch.

Explanation: The validation set covers a narrow, simpler region of the feature spaceâ€”fixed pitch (1600), selected CD and space valuesâ€”making these patterns easier to generalize.
In contrast, the training set contains a wider variety of CDs, space values, and both directions, introducing more complexity and challenging the modelâ€™s ability to generalize across the full data manifold. This pushes up the average training error.


---

Absolute train-val RMSE gap shrinks only because both errors worsen.

Diagnosis: Underfitted model. Diverges rather than converges, since RMSE trends go up with epochs and no learning stabilization is observed. Indicates training instability due to insufficient regularization or improper optimizer settings.

Of course, you make your own diagnosis.
