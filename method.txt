# About Me

I'm a Software Engineering Intern in the **Product Engineering** group.  
Working under **[Manager’s Full Name]**, I contribute to internal tools, maintain consistency across merge requests, and follow team workflows for issue tracking, code reviews, and documentation.

## My Focus
- Writing clean, testable code
- Following GitLab flow (issues → branches → MRs)
- Regular commits with meaningful messages
- Participating in team rituals (standups, retros, demos)
