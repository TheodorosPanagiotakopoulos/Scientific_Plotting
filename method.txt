# Neuron Flow Loss Calculator

This repository calculates `loss0`, `loss1`, `loss2`, and `lossAll` for Neuron Flow jobs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages (add any specific dependencies if applicable)

### Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. In `collect_loss.py`, update the path variable to point to your Neuron job.
3. Ensure `get_loss.py` is placed in the **same folder** as `collect_loss.py`, since it is called internally.
4. Set the `verbose` flag in `collect_loss.py` to `True` or `False` depending on whether you want to view detailed loss output.

   ```python
   verbose = True  # or False

How to Run

Make sure both collect_loss.py and get_loss.py are in the same directory. Then execute:

python collect_loss.py

The script will output the losses as Python lists:

Loss0: [ ... ]
Loss1: [ ... ]
Loss2: [ ... ]
LossAll: [ ... ]

These lists can be used for further analysis, visualization, or diagnostics.
